::: {.rmdbox}

Five balls, numbered $1$, $2$, $3$, $4$, and $5$, are placed in an urn. Two balls are randomly selected from the five, and their numbers noted. Find the probability distribution for the following:

a. The largest of the two sampled numbers

b. The sum of the two sampled numbers

:::

* I consider all possible selections:

* Later, I will look into the distribution for the maximum, the minimum etc.


### 3.7 {-}

::: {.rmdbox}

Each of three balls are randomly placed into one of three bowls. Find the probability distribution for $Y ={}$ the number of empty bowls.

:::

* There are $3^3 = 27$ possible placements.

* For $0$ empty bowls: the number of permutations of $123$: $P_3 = 6$.

* For $1$ empty bowl: 

  1. Choose bowl to be empty: $3$.
  
  1. Choose $2$ balls to be together: $3$.
  
  1. Choose one of the nonempty bowls to have $2$ balls: $2$.
  
  For a total of $18$. 
  
* For $2$ empty bowls: $3$

* Distribution:
  
  $$
  \begin{array}{|r|r|}
  \hline
  y 	&  P(Y=y) \\\hline
  0 	&  2/9 	  \\
  1 	&  2/3 	  \\
  2 	&  1/9 	  \\\hline
  \end{array}

## 3.3 The Expected Value of a Random Variable or a Function of a Random Variable {-}

::: {.rmdbox}

If $Y$ is a discrete random variable that assigns positive probabilities to only the positive integers, show that
$$
E(Y) = \sum_{k=1}^\infty P(Y \geq k)
$$

So we have the recursion
$$
p(y) = p(y - 1) \cdot \frac{(n - y + 1)p}{yq} \quad \text{for } y > 0
$$

#### (b) {-}

#### (d) {-}

See [item (c) above](#c).


### 3.64 {-}

::: {.rmdbox}

If there are $n$ trials in a binomial experiment and we observe $n_0$ successes, show that $P(Y = y_0)$ is maximized when $p = \frac{y_0}{n}$.

### 3.65 {-}

::: {.rmdbox}

The *maximum likelihood estimator* for $p$ is $\frac{Y}{n}$.

a. Compute $E(Y/n)$.

b. Compute $\text{Var}(Y/n)$. What happens to it as $n$ gets larger?

:::

#### (a) {-}

$$
E\left(\frac Y n\right) = \frac{E(Y)}{n} = \frac{np}{n} = p
$$

This means we have [an unbiased estimator for $p$.]{.hl}


#### (b) {-}

$$
\text{Var}\left(\frac Y n\right) = \frac{\text{Var}(Y)}{n^2} = \frac{npq}{n^2} = 
\frac{pq}{n}
$$

As $n$ gets larger, this tends to zero.

In other words, [if I want to estimate $p$ in a binomial experiment, a larger number of trials will give me a smaller variance.]{.hl}


### More about the binomial distribution {-}

#### Exact test {-}

* Exact test: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fisher%27s_exact_test


#### Binomial test and $\chi$-squared test {-}

* $\chi$-squared test: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pearson%27s_chi-squared_test

  > When the test is applied to a contingency table containing two rows and two columns, the test is equivalent to a Z-test of proportions.

  That's why R shows the $\chi^2$ statistic for the binomial test!
